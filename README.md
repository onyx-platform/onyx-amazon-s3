## onyx-amazon-s3

Onyx plugin for Amazon S3.

#### Installation

In your project file:

```clojure
[org.onyxplatform/onyx-amazon-s3 "0.11.1.0-alpha1"]
```

#### ABS TODO

* Need some way to control batch sizes. batch-timeout is not supported in ABS currently
* 

#### Functions

##### Input Task

In your peer boot-up namespace:

```clojure
(:require [onyx.plugin.s3-input])
```

Catalog entry:

```clojure
{:onyx/name task-name
 :onyx/plugin :onyx.plugin.s3-input/input
 :onyx/type :input
 :onyx/medium :s3
 :onyx/batch-size 20
 :onyx/max-peers 1
 :s3/bucket "mybucket"
 :s3/prefix "filter-prefix/example/"
 :s3/deserializer-fn :my.ns/deserializer-fn
 :s3/buffer-size-bytes 10000000
 :onyx/doc "Reads segments from keys in an S3 bucket."}
```

Lifecycle entry:

```clojure
{:lifecycle/task <<TASK_NAME>>
 :lifecycle/calls :onyx.plugin.s3-input/s3-input-calls}
```

#### Attributes

|key                           | type      | description
|------------------------------|-----------|------------
|`:s3/bucket`                  | `string`  | The name of the s3 bucket to read objects from.
|`:s3/deserializer-fn`         | `keyword` | A namespaced keyword pointing to a fully qualified function that will deserialize from bytes to segments. Currently only reading from newline separated values is supported, thus the serializer must deserialize line by line.
|`:s3/prefix`                  | `string`  | Filter the keys to be read by a supplied prefix.
|`:s3/file-key`                | `string`  | When set, includes the S3 key of file from which the segment's line was read under this key.

##### Output Task

In your peer boot-up namespace:

```clojure
(:require [onyx.plugin.s3-output])
```

Catalog entry:

```clojure
{:onyx/name <<TASK_NAME>>
 :onyx/plugin :onyx.plugin.s3-output/output
 :s3/bucket <<BUCKET_NAME>>
 :s3/encryption :none
 :s3/serializer-fn :my.ns/serializer-fn
 :s3/key-naming-fn :onyx.plugin.s3-output/default-naming-fn
 :s3/prefix "filter-prefix/example/"
 :s3/serialize-per-element? false
 :onyx/type :output
 :onyx/medium :s3
 :onyx/batch-size 20
 :onyx/doc "Writes segments to s3 files, one file per batch"}
```

Segments received by this task must be serialized to bytes by the `:s3/serializer-fn`,
into a file per batch, placed at a key in the bucket which is named via the
function defined at `:s3/key-naming-fn`. This function takes an event map and
returns a string. Using the default naming function, `:onyx.plugin.s3-output/default-naming-fn`,
 will name keys in the following format in UTC time format:
 "yyyy-MM-dd-hh.mm.ss.SSS_batch_BATCH_UUID".

You can define `:s3/encryption` to be `:aes256` if your S3 bucket has
encryption enabled. The default value is `:none`.

When `:s3/serialize-per-element?` is set to true, the serializer will be called
on each individual segmnt, rather than the whole batch, and will be separated
by the string value set in `:s3/serialize-per-element-separator`.

Lifecycle entry:

```clojure
{:lifecycle/task <<TASK_NAME>>
 :lifecycle/calls :onyx.plugin.s3-output/s3-output-calls}
```

|`:s3/prefix`                           | `string`  | A prefix to prepend to the keys generated by `:s3/key-naming-fn`.
|`:s3/content-type`                     | `string`  | Optional content type for value
|`:s3/encryption`                       | `keyword` | Optional server side encryption setting. One of `:sse256` or `:none`.
